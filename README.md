OpenStreetMap and the 2D visualization library IO2D to build a route planner that displays a path
between two points on a map.

### W1: Intro to C++ Lang :
In this week, you will build on your previous programming
experience to learn the basics of the C++ language. By the end of
this week, you will use vectors, loops, and I/O libraries to parse
data from a file and print an ASCII board. You will use this board in
the next lesson for a simplified route planning application.

### W2: A* Search Alogrithm :
In this week, you will learn about the A* search algorithm. Over a
sequence of exercises, you will use your A* search implementation
to plan a path through the obstacles in the ASCII board.

### Mid-Course Project: ASCII A* Search
Provide a grid file with obstacles to your program. Your program
will then be able to use A* search to find a path from the start to
the end of the board through the obstacles. The program will also
be able to print the solution to the screen with nice ASCII
formatting.

### W3: Writting Larger Programs and Using OpenStreetMap Data
In this week, you will learn the syntax for C++ language features
that you will need for the next steps in the course. This includes an
overview of header files, pointers, build tools, and classes. You’ll
also learn about OpenStreetMap data and look at the IO2D map
display code that you will be extending for your project.

### W4: A* with OpenStreetMap Data
Over a sequence of exercises during this week, you will extend the
IO2D map display code to use A*, so your program will be able to
find a path between two points on the map.

### Course Final Project: Build and OpenStreetMap Route Planner
This project will combine the work that you have completed over
the previous two weeks. When the project is finished, you will be
able to select starting and ending areas on a city map, and your
program will find a path along the city streets to connect the start
and end.

## Course 2: Object-Oriented Programming

Explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ with examples and exercises covering the
essentials of OOP like abstraction and inheritance all the way through to advanced topics like
polymorphism and templates. In the end, you’ll build a Linux system monitor application to
demonstrate C++ OOP in action!

### W1: Intro to OOP In C++:
In the first lessons of this course, you’ll meet your instructors, get
some context for what object oriented programming (OOP) is and
practice implementing some of the basic features of OOP, like
encapsulation and abstraction.

### W2: Access Modifiers and Inheritance
C++ classes have extensive functionality when it comes to what
kind of members you can define within a class and how you can
prevent or provide access to those members. In addition, like many
other languages, one class can inherit from another. In this lesson
you’ll investigate the intricacies of access modifiers and inheritance
to build more complex C++ classes.

### W3: Polymorphism and Templates
With polymorphism, you can write member functions for a class
that do different things depending on what parameters you pass to
them. Using templates, you can write generic functions that accept
many different kinds of input parameter types. With these tools
you can add more diverse functionality to your C++ classes and in
this lesson you’ll do just that.

### Course Final Project: System Monitor
In this project, you’ll get a chance to put C++ OOP into action! You’ll
write a Linux system monitor with similar functionality to the
widely used htop application. This will not only provide you more
familiarity the Linux operating system, but also give you insights
into how a collection of objects can function together in C++ to
form an exciting and complete application!

## Course 3: Memory Management

Discover the complexity of memory management in C++ by diving deep into stack vs. heap, pointers,
references, new, delete and much more. By the end, you’ll write your very own smart pointer!

### W1: Stack Vs Heap:
Generally speaking memory management in C++ is divided into two
main categories by their storage in the host machine, stack and
heap. In this lesson, you’ll learn to identify the difference between
the two and how they are used in practice.

### W2: Pointers and References: 
Pointers and references are used in C++ to give one variable access
to the contents of another. While they share many similarities, their
differences are important when it comes to implementation. In this
lesson you’ll get hands on practice with pointers and references
and how best to use them.

### W3: New, Delete, Memset and Malloc
The New, Delete, Memset and Malloc operators allow you to
perform what’s known as dynamic memory allocation in C++. This
gives you the flexibility to allocate memory to objects of variable
size, like linked lists or trees. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to
dynamically allocate and deallocate memory and avoid memory
leaks!

### W4: Smart Pointers:
Smart pointers are the C++ solution to achieving better memory
management in your code. Smart pointers automatically deallocate
memory for objects that go out of scope and make it much easier
for you as a programmer to avoid memory leaks. In this lesson,
you’ll get experience working with smart pointers and see how they
can make your code more robust.

### Course Final Prokect: Smart Pointers:
The best way to synthesize all the memory management concepts
you’ve worked with in this course is to build your own smart
pointer and compare it to the native implementation. In this project
you’ll get to do just that!

## Course 4: Concurrency

Concurrent programming runs multiple threads of execution in parallel. 
Concurrency is an advanced programming technique that, when properly implemented, 
can dramatically accelerate your C++ programs.

### W1: Parallel Algorithms:
Take advantage of parallel algorithms from the standard library.
Many important libraries have parallel implementations that will
handle parallelization themselves. Relying on these algorithms
minimizes your work, and optimizes performance.

### W2: Threads: 
Threads are parallel lines of execution that run independently but
share common memory and state. Executing different tasks in
different threads allows the system to distribute work to different
processors and run concurrently.

### W3: Thread Synchronization: 
Executing parallel threads that must communicate with each other
is an advanced skill. This must be implemented carefully, to
prevent synchronization errors. But successful implementation can
significantly improve performance.

### Course Final Project: Chatbot: 
Build a multithreaded chatbot that can carry on hundreds of
conversations simultaneously!

## Build Your Own C++ Application

Put your C++ skills to use on a project of your own! You’ll utilize the core 
concepts from this Nanodegree program - object-oriented programming, 
memory management, and concurrency - to build your own application using C++.

### W1: Capstone Work:
Choose your application. Design the architecture. Build a
prototype.

### W2: Capstone Work: 

Complete your application, utilizing the core skills you have
developed: C++ fundamentals, object-oriented programming,
memory management, and concurrency.
